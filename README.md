<b>Executive Summary</b>

The problem that led to the project is the need to create a device to help people who present a form of visuospatial neglect, called left neglect. Patients with this deficit often forget there is an entire world to their left, and have to be constantly reminded to pay attention to the left side by caretakers or therapists. Our client, Dr. Enzler, from the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab, was looking for a solution that would “remind patients to visually scan left”, possibly a wearable device that they could wear around their neck or head to be a “constant reminder”. 

Our goal with this project is to design an affordable, simple, adjustable, and user-friendly device to help patients with left neglect be reminded to visually scan left. 

To develop this design we first had to do some research on the problem. We achieved this both by performing secondary and primary research on the topic. Secondly, we gathered more information from the client interview with Dr. Enzler. After having brainstormed with the class every member of our group created a low-fidelity mockup of their idea and tested it on friends, or on themselves. In our team meetings, our professors offered guidance on the weaknesses and strengths of each of our mockups. After this, we met as a team to decide on which ideas we wanted to focus on the most moving forward. In the following weeks, we created the prototypes and presented them to the class to receive feedback. In addition, we met with the other groups in our section to gain insight into how to implement our app and adapted our product to make it compatible with the other components of our kit.
